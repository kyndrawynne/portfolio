    	<h1>About Kyndra</h1>
      	<p style="margin-bottom:2.8rem;">I’ve always been drawn to <span class="highlight">beautiful things</span>—whether it’s a space that just feels right, a piece of art that speaks to you, or a moment that makes someone feel special.</p>
		<p>Growing up in a family of artists, <span class="highlight">creativity is pretty much in my DNA</span>. One of my earliest memories is begging my grandma to tell me stories, not just because they were good, but because she would <span class="highlight">draw them out as she told them</span>. That’s when I first understood how powerful art can be—it’s not just about what you see, but <span class="highlight">the story it tells</span>.</p>

		<div class="projects-body" style="padding-top:6.3rem;">    
        	<p><span class="highlight">As a kid, I channeled that love of storytelling into scrapbooking</span>. I’d spend hours making collages, turning photos and mementos into little time capsules. It was my way of capturing memories, and I loved it. In high school, I took every art class I could find, and even managed to convince my teacher to let me do an independent study. It was also where I discovered graphic design—<span class="highlight">piecing together elements to create something meaningful and beautiful just clicked for me</span>.</p>

       			<p style="margin-bottom:2.8rem;">But I’ve always had a technical side too. Math and science were my jam, and I was that kid who took all the AP classes. People told me I should go into STEM because, you know, <span class="highlight">“It’s where the money is.”</span> So, I kept my options open. I even got my <span class="highlight">cosmetology license in high school</span> so I could work my way through college. By day, I was cutting hair and chatting with clients, and by night, I was studying engineering at community college. It felt like I was living two separate lives, but I loved both.</p>
				<p><span class="highlight">When I got to university, I had to make a choice. My brother, who’s always been someone I look up to, was deep into computer science at ASU, and the more he talked about his projects, the more fascinated I became. So, I decided to hang up my shears and dive headfirst into tech.</span></p>

			<h2>Finding My Path</h2>
			<p>That led to a gig at Microsoft as a Commercial Tech Support Advocate. It was intense, but I learned so much—<span class="highlight">mostly that I’m pretty good at listening to people and solving their problems</span>. I even got to work with the design team, giving feedback on user interfaces. I loved it, but then the layoffs came, and I found myself at a crossroads.</p>
            <p>Honestly, it was a blessing in disguise. I had time to explore other interests, like blockchain and crypto (thanks to my brother again). I dove in, did my research, and ended up with a summer internship at ZkSync. My job? <span class="highlight">Making complex stuff understandable</span>. I wrote educational content, suggested product changes to make things more user-friendly, and generally tried to <span class="highlight">make the space a little less intimidating for newbies</span>.</p>

		<div class="projects-body" style="padding-top:6.3rem;">   
			<div class="projects-group">   
       			<p style="margin-bottom:2.8rem;">Through that, I got involved with Blockchain at ASU, which is where I met Yalor from MetaCartel. He was doing cool things, and I wanted in. That’s where I really started <span class="highlight">blending my tech skills with design</span>—whether it was event pages, social media content, or sponsor decks, I was all in. <span class="highlight">My tech world and art world finally came together, and it just felt right.</span></p>
				<p>Now, I’m <span class="highlight">three classes away from a degree in computer science</span>, and I’ve found my sweet spot in UX/UI design. I’m excited to keep creating experiences that are not only beautiful but also meaningful and human-centered.</p>

				<h2>Beyond the Screen</h2>
				<p>Outside of work, I’m settling into life in LA with my girlfriend and our dog. My current goals include <span class="highlight">keeping my tomato plants alive</span> (easier said than done), getting the most out of our <span class="highlight">new e-bike</span>, and discovering the best food spots around town. If you’ve got any recommendations, I’m all ears!</p>
